# The-Snowball-Effect
A small game written in Java. Created to inspire younger children that I teach by showing them what Computer Science can create as well as to practice game development stratagies.

To run first have java installed on your local machine or clone in repl.it

After navigate to desired directory and run `javac *.java` to compile followed by `java Main` to launch.
